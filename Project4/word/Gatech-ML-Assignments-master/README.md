# Gatech-ML-Assignments

Assignment 1 covers Supervised learning.
Experimenting with supervised algorithms - Decision tree, Neural network, KNN, Boosting and SVM on 2 datasets.


Assigment 2 is about Randomized optimization.

Experiments with Randomized optimization algorithms for optimizing weights for neural network and to experiment with 3 different optimization problems.


Each folder will have a mukund3-analysis.pdf which contains the analysis submitted for the assignment. To know more, go throught the README's of corresponding folders.
