Author: pjain67

## Tools/libraries used
- ABIGAIL
- OpenCSV

## How to run experiments
Using IntelliJ Idea (freely availible), open the folder code. To run experiments, click the relevant runner and click the run button in IntelliJ. This will run the runner and export the results under the results directory.

If you do not have IntelliJ Idea, I have included ant scripts for compiling the code.

## Relevant Runners
- Main (average performance)
- MainPart1SA (tuning cooling rate for SA)
- MainPart1GA (tuning initial population size for GA)
